Yeah, I had the same problem. The problem is that from Java we only can
access the X server by TCP (JSch tries the usual port on 6000+display
number),
while Ubuntu (as some other Linux distributions) lets the X server listen
only on
a Unix domain socket (by default).

I asked this question about this: http://askubuntu.com/q/41330/11138

You should not need to use xhost - the authentication should be better
done by the authentication cookie.

There are essentially these possibilities on Ubuntu:

* configure the X-server to listen on TCP, and then configure
  your firewall not to let anyone from outside in.
  (See http://askubuntu.com/q/34657/11138
for details - you have
   to remove `-nolisten tcp` from the relevant config file.)

* What I finally did, I think: Use `socat` to forward TCP traffic
  to the right Unix port. (The command line is mentioned in my
  answer on http://askubuntu.com/q/41330/11138.)

* Another way could be to use some Java library which provides
  access to Unix domain sockets (usually by JNI/JNA) and somehow
  marry it with JSch (or simply use it for port-forwarding similar
  to socat). Here is a list of some which I bookmarked when I last
  investigated this problem:

I'm not sure what is the case on Mac OS - is the X server here
active by default? If so, have a look on its configuration, it
might be the same problem (and similar solutions).
(If you have a `netstat` program, try `netstat -l` and look for
TCP on port 6000 or following, or a unix port named something
with X in it).
